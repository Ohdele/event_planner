# Event Planner

## Project Overview

In this lab, I created a React application with a component called `EventPlanner`. This project helped me understand how to structure React components effectively. The `EventPlanner` component includes various sections, such as descriptions, event categories, features, testimonials, and a contact form.


- **Component Structure**: I built a structured hierarchy of React components. The `EventPlanner` component is designed to manage and display different sections of the application.

- **Form Handling**: I added a contact form to the `EventPlanner` component. This involved combining textareas, input fields, and a submit button to allow users to send messages.

- **Using Static Content**: I utilized static content like titles, paragraphs, and list items to provide information about the event planning app. This included displaying event categories and features.

## Summary

This project demonstrates how to create and manage a React component structure, handle forms, and use static content effectively. Itâ€™s a practical example of building an event planning application with React.
